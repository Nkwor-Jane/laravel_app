# laravel_app
Create a Basic Laravel Application

## Setup
- Use the latest stable version of Laravel for the installation.
- The application should include the default Laravel directory structure and configuration files (e.g., .env, routes/web.php, etc.).
- Ensure that the basic authentication features (login, registration) are working out of the box.
- The database connection should be set up (but no tables or migrations are needed for this ticket).
- Include basic default views and a route to display a home page.
- The application should run without any errors after installation and configuration, with minimal setup required from the user (e.g., database setup).
